Udacity Bike-share Project
overview about my project:
	I have created this Udacity project to improve my python programming in the nano degree for Data Science Udacity program. 
-Intro:
	This code is written for the 2nd Project of Udacity's Data Analyst Nano-degree and it is used to study data for bike share systems related to Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
This imports data from csv files and computes stats to describe the data.
This also takes user’s input to create an interactive menu experience in the terminal to present these calculations.

Bike-share Dataset:
	The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017.
